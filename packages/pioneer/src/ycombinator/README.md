I am a pioneer from pioneer.app

### IDEA

#### Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?

I was doing a study session through Zoom with my friends back in March, and it was a terrible experience.
When you're tyring to way too many steps to get a session going, you get distracted by keyboard sounds, and it meant nothing if it were put on mute.
I thought that if
I have basically no domain expertise in the field of video communications.


#### What's new about what you're making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't know about it)?

I want to
Zoom/Meets/Tandem

#### Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors? Who do you fear most?

#### What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don't get?

- The UI of a video conferencing screen should be OPTIMIZED depending on the usecase.
- Having a video-chat with someone should be more of an awesome experience.
-

#### How do or will you make money? How much could you make?

We charge \$15/month per user.
Roughly at least 50~60% gross margin.
I don't know how much could I make in the short term, but I could be the best decision your organization has ever made.

#### How will you get users? If your idea is the type that faces a chicken-and-egg problem in the sense that it won't be attractive to users till it has a lot of users (e.g. a marketplace, a dating site, an ad network), how will you overcome that?

It's basically a team-based tool like Notion/Slack, so if the product is great, it likely will virally grow on itself.
If not, it will die.

### EQUITY

#### Have you incorporated, or formed any legal entity (like an LLC) yet?

Yes

#### What kind of entity and in what state or country was the entity formed?

Delaware C Corp
