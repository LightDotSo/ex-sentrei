### SKILLS

#### Please tell us about the time you, shunkakinoki, most successfully hacked some (non-computer) system to your advantage.

It was after practice of the summer camp of the high-school swimming team, we had to dry up a few dozen kickboards within a relatively small area. Lacking the usual shelves to put them up, we devised of a way to put together the boards triangularly so they would all fit while having enough distance between each other for them to dry out.

#### Please tell us in one or two sentences about the most impressive thing other than this startup that you have built or achieved.

Key Features

1. Enhances.

The video chat UI will be optimized depending on the use-case. No same blatant set of controls each time. We aim to deliver the best possible user experience through providing dedicated features depending on the purpose of each room.

2. Fun.

Compete with your teammates through a dedicated leaderboard, and occasionally poke at others if you are feeling like taking a break. Hop into "bonding" rooms to recreate the feeling of spontaneous conversations online.

3. Seamless.

Enter the same virtual room when you want to get to work (same static link always!!!), and never worry about time-limits, invitations, or passcodes. Everything is minimalistic and kept simple as possible for your team.

#### Where do you live now, and where would the company be based after YC?

Tokyo, Japan / Cupertino, U.S.A.

### PROGRESS

#### How far along are you?

Beta Launch.
I am in the process of refining the product.
I think I will keep on making improvements until I've reached a point where I will want to buy my own product.

#### How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.

From April 2021, full time since then.
Thankfully, I'm lucky enough to have the blessing to be with my family for now,
but mom has warned me that I will get kicked out next April.

#### Are people using your product?

Yes

#### How many active users or customers do you have? If you have some particularly valuable customers, who are they? If you're building hardware, how many units have you shipped?

About ~10 users during the beta launch.
Frankly speaking, most of the beta testers are my friends.
It's hard for me to say we have particularly valuable customers at this point in time.

#### Do you have revenue?

No

#### Anything else you would like us to know regarding your revenue or growth rate?

#### If you are applying with the same idea, did anything change? If you applied with a different idea, why did you pivot and what did you learn from the last idea?

This is my first application.

#### If you have already participated or committed to participate in an incubator, "accelerator" or "pre-accelerator" program, please tell us about it.

I am a pioneer from https://pioneer.app (fully remote accelerator) from August, 2020.

### IDEA

#### Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?

I was occasionally doing a study session through Zoom with my friends back in March, and it was far from a good experience.

1. Too many steps to get a session going even for the same consistent group of people (links, passcodes, etc...)
2. You get distracted by keyboard sounds if un-muted, video chat seems unnecessary otherwise.
3. UI is always the same even for very different purposes.

I believe that the end user experience could be much better if the video chat UI was more optimized for each specific use-case like I encountered.

I have basically no domain expertise in the field of video communications though Twilio would take it care for us.

I know that people need what I'm making through feedback at https://pioneer.app, stories of my friends and their parents complaining in which particular areas current video communication tools lack in, and Jason Calacanis mentioning on his podcast that he had a secondary display that was always on to recreate the office experience remotely.

#### What's new about what you're making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't know about it)?

The new thing about Sentrei is that the UI will drastically change depending on the use-case.
We believe that we could deliver a much better user experience if each video session is optimized for each purpose.

We plan to provide three options.

1. Bond. - Short conversations & spontaneous chats through a colorful and enjoyful UI.
2. Focus. - Always-connected sessions for tele-presence to help you get things done through a zen-like interface.
3. Work. - Seamless meetings between members for doing synchronous work (basically like Zoom).

I tend to resort to Zoom/Meets/Tandem, and most people do so.

#### Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors? Who do you fear most?

Current competitors

- Pragli (https://pragli.com/)
- Sidekick (https://sidekick.video/)
- Tandem (https://tandem.chat/)

I fear most that Zoom comes out with a Slack-like alternative, equipped with features that make it not like Zoom, tailored for teams.
We do not want to compete with the above, but rather act as a supplement for Slack and Zoom.
Thus, Zoom coming out with a Slack-like alternative video chat tool could be devastating for us.

#### What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don't get?

- Every video chat tool is designed for synchronous & productive communication, yet many people use it for other purposes as well.
- The UI of a video chat screen should completely be optimized depending on the use-case.
- Being on a virtual workspace should be a lot more comfortable and fun, not clumsy and stressful.

#### How do or will you make money? How much could you make?

We charge \$15/month per user for the pro plan, custom pricing for enterprise plan.

The cost would mostly consist of Twilio video server cost(avg. \$0.003 per particpant).
On the assumption that each user spends 3hr per weekday on the platform, that would lead to a cost of \$10 per month.
That would probably lead to at least 30~40% gross margin.
If we could create a great product to reach PMF, i.e. 100,000 paying customers, that would be about ~\$3 mil MRR, ~\$30 mil ARR.
Under the current circumstances of the world, we have a puncher's chance to grow exponentially.

We could be the best decision your organization has ever made.

#### How will you get users? If your idea is the type that faces a chicken-and-egg problem in the sense that it won't be attractive to users till it has a lot of users (e.g. a marketplace, a dating site, an ad network), how will you overcome that?

It's a team-based tool like Notion/Slack, so if the product is great, it likely will grow virally.
If not, it will die.

### EQUITY

#### Have you incorporated, or formed any legal entity (like an LLC) yet?

Yes

#### What kind of entity and in what state or country was the entity formed?

Delaware C Corp

### LEGAL

#### Are any of the founders covered by noncompetes or intellectual property agreements that overlap with your project? If so, please explain.

#### Please tell us something surprising or amusing that one of you has discovered.

I don't remember.
