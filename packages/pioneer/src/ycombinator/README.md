### SKILLS

#### Please tell us about the time you, shunkakinoki, most successfully hacked some (non-computer) system to your advantage.

It was after practice of the summer camp of the high-school swimming team, we had to dry up a few dozen kickboards in a relatively small area. Lacking the usual shelves to put them up, we devised of a way to put together the kickboards triangularly so they would all fit while having enough distance between each other for them to dry out.

### IDEA

#### Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?

I was doing a study session through Zoom with my friends back in March, and it was far from a good experience.

1) Too many steps to get a session going even for the same consistent group of people (links, passcodes, etc...)
2) You get distracted by keyboard sounds if un-muted, video screen seems unnecessary otherwise.
3) UI is the same even for very different situations (bonding, focusing, working)

I thought that the end user experience could be much better if the video chat UI was more optimized for specific usecases.

I have basically no domain expertise in the field of video communications.

<<<<<<< HEAD
I know that people need what I'm making through feedback at pioneer.app, stories of my friends and their parents complaining particular areas current video communications tools lack in, and Jason Calacanis mentioning on his podcast that he had a secondary display that was always on to recreate the office experience remotely.

#### What's new about what you're making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't know about it)?

I want to make Sentrei the most seamless experience for
I guess I tend to resort to Zoom/Meets/Tandem, and most people do so.

#### Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors? Who do you fear most?

#### What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don't get?

- The UI of a video conferencing screen should be optimized depending on the usecase.
- Having a video-chat with someone should be more of an awesome experience in entirety.
-

#### How do or will you make money? How much could you make?

We charge \$15/month per user.
Roughly at least 50~60% gross margin.
I don't know how much could I make in the short term, but I could be the best decision your organization has ever made.

#### How will you get users? If your idea is the type that faces a chicken-and-egg problem in the sense that it won't be attractive to users till it has a lot of users (e.g. a marketplace, a dating site, an ad network), how will you overcome that?

It's basically a team-based tool like Notion/Slack, so if the product is great, it likely will virally exponentionally.
If not, it will die.

### EQUITY

Yes

#### What kind of entity and in what state or country was the entity formed?
