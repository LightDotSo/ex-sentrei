This is such an awesome product. Great execution, I really admire your work. Regarding the product itself, I was wondering how you were going to onboard users, particularly if the target isn't likely to be a early-adopter and much less sure about technology .Otherwise, I really respect and love your work and itâ€™s really a joy being able to see your progress week to week. Good luck on the product!

I love the idea. Also, I admire your degree of execution. Truly inspiring. With that being said, I wondered what was the exact selling point of the product. Why would I use your product instead of Stripe? Is it more focused on small businesses in the real world in person? Otherwise, the landing page was well-though out and really impressive. I am looking forward to your product launch! Good luck on the product!

This is such an awesome product. Great execution, I really admire your work. Regarding the product itself, I was wondering how you guys will beat out the competition since I can recall seeing similar products that lets you gather app information. With that being said, I thought you could refine parts of the landing page so that it would look more professional and beautiful. Good luck on the product!

Great work so far! I loved the idea of your project as well. Great progress. I love the idea that you are building your own newsletter/medium to a niche target audience. I also love the fact that you are opting for a more minimalistic approach in the process of validating the idea, which is awesome! With that being said, I thought it would be better if you could provide an excerpt on the example newsletter article.
